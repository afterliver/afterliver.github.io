    <p>Last Guards Left is an initiative to bring old good attitudes into modern civilization. 
        We try to understand and solve the deterioration of society around us.<br>
        In short, here are the (perhaps Europe-specific) problems and the way we aim to solve them:</p>
    <p>
    <b style="color:red;">Problems</b>
    <ul>
    <li> <b>goalless, unchanging comfort:</b><br> makes people insensitive to reality and passive or not concerned. 
    The public barely publicly question anything, even when things get bad...
    <li> <b>no real (public) actors:</b><br> people lose awareness of the foundation of humanity.<br>
    <i>Eg. people use 200 liters of water a day and don't perceive that having any consequences</i><br>
    So, they see no issues to be discussed, no decision is made and the state loses identity. People having no opinion also makes democracy powerless.
    <li> <b>economy of pride:</b><br> In abundance, people stop doing real change. Persons, companies and politicians use intellectuality, bureaucracy and networks to achieve grandiosity. So, legal procedures, information nets and theoretical knowledge get overvalued - in other words, the system breeds lengthy pointless procedures.<br> 
    <i>Eg. calling sophisticated company meetings just to feel cultivated/important</i><br>
    </ul>
    All this makes society less self-aware and makes scheming the only point. That is why
    psychopaths get to the top, even ones who have no self-awareness and no understanding of
    the story of modern civilization. <br>
    <div id="toFall">What dystopian trends do we see? (in detail)</div>
    </p><p>
    <b style="color:red;">Our initiative</b><br>
    We are students, not rich investors or tech developers. 
    We launched this out of passion for the things we want to see happen.
    </p><p>
    Above all, we want politics and careers to be an <b>extension of ordinary life,</b>
    where it's not only about machinations and financial empire-building, 
    but also strong identity and sensible relationships with others. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Our state, <i>We Are Legion Capitalism,</i>

    <ul>
    <li> <b></b> </li>
    <li> <b>intuitive politics:</b> Politics should be an extension of ordinary life, so leaders have the same attitude and code of conduct as ordinary good people among themselves.
    <li> <b>strong identity:</b> The state should have a clear, recognized role and be aware of it. A role such that when regular people join it, they naturally understand and embrace it.
    <li> <b>recognition:</b> Every soul should know what the state respects them for. Know the treatment they can (reliably) expect from the leaders, and understand the state's intentions.<br>
        Then, people will act fairly and leave the way free for the projects to succeed, even if they disagree.<br> Even the poorest can know the nation's relation to them if we use intuitive politics.
    </ul>

<b style="color:red;">Our initiative</b><br>
We are students, not rich investors or tech developers. We launched this out of passion for the things we want to see happen. But they don't, so let's make them happen. Here they are:
<b>Our wishes</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Code of enmity:</b> We disagree with the condemnation and lack of mutual recognition today.
To give an example, imagine it's 8.10. (after the Hamas attack). If Hamas is really antisemitic,
we (as the Czech republic) would have sent 
<span class="onblue" id="iranletter">this</span> to Iran and 
<span class="onblue" id="israelletter">this</span> to Israel. Why does no one do that? 
It is all "complicated", but we believe a simple to-the-point clarification of
Arab terrorists - West relations would have helped.</li>
</ul> 
<br><br>
<b>Our civilization model</b><br>
For us, the foundation of any good state is a code of honor accepted among all people and classes.<br>
That is mostly intuitive, shared among all people and needn't be written down, but to be clear, here it is:<br>
<b>Code of Honor</b> (this is cliche/obvious, but deserves to be declared still)
<ul>
<li><b>Harmony.</b> Try to let things around us run smoothly. Disrupting the foundation of the system (especially if deceptively) is an act of enmity and disrespect.
<li><b>Assertivity.</b> Always point out unsolved wrong things. Clarify the problem and declare the acts you're determined to do. Never let a wrong thing pass just because you face a stronger opponent; if the righteous act is clear, do it.
<li><b>Responsibility.</b> You should expect that you will not be spared from judgement. You will be allowed to recover, but your wrongdoings will be set right. 
<li><b>Humans are beings.</b> You may condemn or even fight them if they clearly desire to be harmful and can't be convinced. But you aren't allowed to trap and choke the voice of the enemies, not even terrorists. Any opponent might turn out to be worthy of peace.
<li><b>Focus.</b> There is always hope to do a great thing, even a small one. Even if you sinned, don't be dragged down and focus on taking new opportunities wisely, not regretting old ones. Don't condemn or ridicule a man for small sins. Recognize him for his potential.
<li><b>Weakness.</b> Reality is always dragged by forces greater than us and rooted in principles we can't change. We can only live by the innate understanding God gave us. So, don't seek perfection or full control. Ask your senses what good you can do today...
<li><b>Clarity and readiness.</b> The nation must understand what their system runs on and keep the roles clear.<br>
    Not every farmer needs detailed political knowledge, but they need to notice their relations with the leaders. A nation must be able to unite and set things right, not let itself be coordinated by a system that divides it and neutralizes its position.
<li><b>Self-hold.</b> Examine your attitudes and know yourself. Hearing others' opinions is helpful, but stay focused on the mission and not others' anger, praise, or emotion in general. </li>
<li><b>Unbreakability.</b> Reduce things to the function they're needed for and don't complicate them further - unless it is a matter of culture, where colorful blossom is encouraged. </li>
</ul>
<br>
While values come from personal conviction, they need to be protected among all society for it
to hold together. So, we need a system that leads people to those values. How?

Firstly, to prove and sharpen everyone's mind, they must live in a natural balance.<br>
What it means:<br>
- People get food and basic everyday assistance from their peers in the local community.
Fair treatment among themselves is up to them:
leaders will only step in if real (physical) harm, hunger, illness or terrorist ideology appears.<br>
This seems "barbaric", but as every boy knows, if his misbehavior is a burden to others, he will face others' wrath and have to set himself right.<br>
In modernity however, men's weakness is often protected from judgement. Then, the strong men are hungry to expose the weak ones and make them face justice, not mercy. Bullying and supremacy, here it is.<br>

<br>
It helps people recognize a good leader, who is actually sensible enough to keep it civilized.

    This system combines the efficiency and energy of capitalism 
    with the dedication and clarity of mind of monarchy. Here are its main pillars:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>clear sectors:</b> 
        Each business field has a ministry which <b>determines its function</b> 
        and <b>directs its development.</b> This way, it is clear what each field is working on 
        and the leaders can keep it simple = adjustable & effective.<br> 
        The ministry runs a small efficient "professional market" to supply the businesses with what they need, instead of each business having to set up all the logistics their own way.<br>
        Don't get it wrong, the market is still free/profit-driven, but the companies who fulfill the
        ministry's instructions will get funding to help them grow and extend their good impact.<br>
        <span id="transprules">See an example here (transport).</span><br>
    <i>The lack of clear sectors is why Europe is a pain to reform. 
        Its economy has no clear boundaries and its dynamics are hard to deconstruct, 
        since each company solves problems their own way, touches different fields of enterprise etc. 
        So, restricting the dynamics of economy would require to 
        completely reconstruct each economic field from divided parts of the original companies 
        (near impossible task).</i>

    <i>Agreed upon by generals of Czech republic, emergency meeting 23.10.2023</i><br>
    May the peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.<br>
    Dear leaders of Iran,<br>
    as war sentiment rises on both sides of the Gaza conflict, many have raised concerns in Europe
    and we need to declare our stance on the crisis. Given our plans, we are likely to meet Iran
    many more times. So, our mutual stance today matters for the future.<br><br>

    It is hard to tell, but we see Hamas and Hezbollah as brothers of Iran. You are prominent
    supporters of such movements in the region. Iran might not have direct oversight or control,
    but you certainly back the jihad-like sentiment they live by.<br><br>
    
    So, we expect that Hamas and Hezbollah keep Iran's decisions in mind, even amidst raging war.
    Practically, you are head of the anti-Israeli mission.<br><br>

    We assume there is evil in Israel, as is everywhere else. Especially given right-wing Zionism,
    fueled by the idea of Israel as God's chosen nation.<br>
    But Israeli soldiers likely aren't fighting out of pride. We know, Jews don't let
    each other down, having faced actual antisemitism countless times. They might disagree
    with Netanyahu, but they can't divide Israel into dispute while their soldier compatriots
    are relying on them. They can only set the regime right when their land is safe again.<br><br>

    So,

<div id="transpRules" class="modal">
    <h3>Transport</h3>
    This sector ensures:
    <ul>
    <li>1. readiness to evacuate a large amount of people or deliver them supplies quickly (any place in the country)
    <li>2. cheap slow transport for masses of material or goods across large distances (horse-powered chariots are literally enough)</li>
    <li>3. a small operational force of (probably) helicopters for emergency or quick transport of urgent passengers
    <li>4. affordable transport of people to work will be profitable in just very few places across the country. So, routine passenger transport is just taxi for rich businessmen.
    <li>5. observes the places it travels and brings interesting / concerning news first-hand
    </ul>
    The government will promote a company that enhances their normal work (2. and 4.) to fulfill 5.<br>
    Companies for 1. and 3. will be paid by government directly.
</div>
<div id="agriRules" class="modal" style="font-size: small;">
    In Africa, a large part of solving poverty (and hunger) is preventing stealing and violence.<br>
    So, we will ask local communities to name one person responsible for dividing food supplies among them.
    The person needs to be a force and a safekeeper in their community and speak Arabic or English on their behalf. <br><br>
    This person will receive our AfriAgri starter pack (see below). 
    They will distribute free food, so no profit involved. <br>Instead, their incentive to improve is to support community life:<br>
    If the community gains recognition in the region, be it through organizing events or watching over the safety of the land, the AfriAgri leader can get promoted.<br><br>
    Proven as sensible leaders / mediators, they will become<br>
    heads of prestigious schools, judges or council chairmen. This brings intuitive 
    justice and relationships into politics, which is what we embrace.<br><br>
    <b>Fun fact: Model of agriculture in dry, desolate land</b><br>
    A light, simple-to-build, scalable construction that can produce certain crops (and protect from heat/drought)
    <img src="afriAgri.png" width="300"><br>
    <b>1. Water container.</b> Should be of <b>highly elastic material</b> so it can be
    transported small & shapeless, stretched out and wrapped around the corners to form a large monolithic insulation (and hold water in it).<br>
    <b>2. Osmotic membrane.</b> Allows water to pour into the soil, but holds the soil from dissolving into the water. The membrane should cover the whole floor (no. 4) and be stretchable, so plant roots can expand downward.<br>
    <b>3. Synthetic soil.</b> 
    Each plant gets a thin layer of nutrient-rich soil 
    (chemically carved so the nutrient flow is similar to that in the plant's natural soils). 
    Each crop type needs to be grown large-scale, so that producing and importing synthetic soil pays off.<br>
    <b>4. Floor.</b> Same material as the container, but when set up, we make a grid of holes in it, cover it with the membrane 
    and push that membrane through each hole downward to touch the water. 
    Then fill such pockets with plant seeds covered in soil and start growing. <br>
    <b>5. Roof/wall.</b> Turns sun heat into electricity and stores it. The efficiency of energy production needn't be as high as solar panels, but the covered area needs to be protected from excess heat. 
    To allow in sunlight, the roof is divided into segments (unidimensionally, so each segment can be folded away by grabbing it from the side of the roof).<br><br>
