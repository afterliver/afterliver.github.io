    <p>Last Guards Left is an initiative to bring old good attitudes into modern civilization. 
        We try to understand and solve the deterioration of society around us.<br>
        In short, here are the (perhaps Europe-specific) problems and the way we aim to solve them:</p>
    <p>
    <b style="color:red;">Problems</b>
    <ul>
    <li> <b>goalless, unchanging comfort:</b><br> makes people insensitive to reality and passive or not concerned (they subconsciously expect unchanging prosperity). 
    The public barely publicly question anything, even when things get bad...
    <li> <b>no real (public) actors:</b><br> people lose awareness of the foundation of humanity.<br>
    <i>Eg. people use 200 liters of water a day and don't perceive that having any consequences</i><br>
    So, they see no issues to be discussed, no decision is made and the state loses identity.<br>
    It may also be due to people not experiencing real social hardship. They don't know how to set things right, because the state has always done that for them.<br>
    The lack of incentive causes reliance on low-effort info (the internet), which is corporate-controlled.<br>
    
    <br>In effect, democracy becomes powerless.
    <li> <b>economy of pride:</b><br> In abundance, people stop doing real change. Persons, companies and politicians use intellectuality, bureaucracy and networks to achieve grandiosity. So, legal procedures, information nets and theoretical knowledge get overvalued - in other words, the system breeds lengthy pointless procedures.<br> 
    <i>Eg. calling sophisticated company meetings just to feel cultivated/important</i><br>
    </ul>
    All this makes society less self-aware and the economy uncontrollable:<br>
    Psychopaths get to the top despite lacking strong identity/convictions.<br>
    Technological fever gives megacorporates control over people's social status and reality in general.<br>
    People lack incentive to stand for things and say them loud.<br><br>

    <!-- <div id="toFall">What dystopian trends do we see? (in detail)</div> -->
    </p><p>
    <b style="color:red;">Our initiative</b><br>
    We are students, not rich investors or tech developers. 
    We launched this out of passion for the things we want to see happen.
    </p>
    <b>To generalize our goals, before we get to the project - </b>
    <p>
    Above all, we want politics and careers to be an <b>extension of ordinary life,</b>
    where it's not only about machinations and financial empire-building, 
    but also strong identity and sensible relationships with others.<br>
    Leadership should grow from respect in local communities...
    </p>
    <p>
    The market should be competitive and profit-driven, but its output should be restricted
    to sensible things. It should have clear oversight of each economic field, simplify its 
    logistics and restrict its output. This would save loads of intelligence and workforce 
    for real achievement...
    </p>
    <p>
    Real achievement - a lot of business should be driven by rewards from the government 
    for scoring in stated goals, rather than direct profit. This would allow country leaders
    to aim the nation's talent and effort at decisive changes around them, rather than 
    each person working for their own sake.
    </p>
    <b style="color:red;">Project TradChad</b><br>
    We are developing a simple agricultural model to grow certain crops artificially, 
    unaffected by weather and soil. So, we can supply hungry peoples (eg. in Africa)
    with food, give them worthwhile enterprise to engage in, and also give richer people
    a way of changing the world. 
    <p>
    We wanted to give this dream a more precise shape, so we put together a plan for 
    building a small new civilization from impoverished / corrupt African regions 
    (we have reasons for that!) <br>
    We looked for a civilized, unnoticed place ruled by traditional people 
    and surrounded by corruption...<br>
    So, as a showcase, here is a plan we would execute. Yes, if it works out, we will!
    </p>
    <table style="width: 100%;"><th style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="wecome.png" width="500"></th></table>
    <h3>Somaliland 2025</h3>
    This country, it really believes in all the things we do. Traditional small communities, 
    leaving others space to succeed, valuing artistic words even in politics (=strong identity!).
    <br><br>
    Given the choice, we would certainly come... and set up a small charitative project, offering 
    poor people a worthwhile enterprise to engage in, and richer people an opportunity to shape the 
    world around them.
    <br><br>
    We are developing a simple agriculture model that 
    lets you grow certain crop types artificially, unaffected by weather and soil. So, we 
    would first raise a small charitative project to make the model run (it isn't very expensive, so). 
    Then, we can setup food supply for hungry peoples (be it from Ethiopia, Kenya or really any other place). 
    Here, the building starts.<br><br>
    
    

    <!--<p>
    

    <ul>
    <li> <b></b> </li>
    <li> <b>intuitive politics:</b> Politics should be an extension of ordinary life, so leaders have the same attitude and code of conduct as ordinary good people among themselves.
    <li> <b>strong identity:</b> The state should have a clear, recognized role and be aware of it. A role such that when regular people join it, they naturally understand and embrace it.
    <li> <b>recognition:</b> Every soul should know what the state respects them for. Know the treatment they can (reliably) expect from the leaders, and understand the state's intentions.<br>
        Then, people will act fairly and leave the way free for the projects to succeed, even if they disagree.<br> Even the poorest can know the nation's relation to them if we use intuitive politics.
    </ul>

        <li><b>1: Water container.</b> Needs to be a light, water-retaining, highly elastic material (so it can be transported as small chunks and then stretched around the corners to form a container shape). The water's weight also shouldn't bend it down (=it needs to be very solid when stretched).

        <li><b>2: Osmotic membrane.</b> Allows water to enter the soil, but doesn't let soil dissolve into the water. Should be very thin, elastic and bendable.

        <li><b>3. Soil.</b> Thin layer of a concentrated mineral mix, tested out to fit a certain crop's needs (so the osmotic flow of water & minerals through the roots is similar to that of a plant in its natural soil). So, we'll need a soil profile for each crop, means of acquiring the minerals cheaply included.

        <li><b>4. Motherboard.</b> Its only point is holding the membrane envelopes with the plants, so it is a grid. It should be divided into segments with joints in one direction, so we can fold the segments together (into a vertical position) and the plant envelopes get a lot closer, forming a line, which is easy to work with/reseed.

        <li><b>5. Energy draft.</b> A shelter, forming the walls and roof. Should transform heat - needn't be effective, but must lead all the energy away from the protected area under its bottom layer. If there was a simple way to gather the energy from it (like electricity), that would be amazing...

    Dear leaders of Iran,<br>
    as war sentiment rises on both sides of the Gaza conflict, many have raised concerns in Europe
    and we need to declare our stance on the crisis. Given our plans, we are likely to meet Iran
    many more times. So, our mutual stance today matters for the future.<br><br>

    It is hard to tell, but we see Hamas and Hezbollah as brothers of Iran. You are prominent
    supporters of such movements in the region. Iran might not have direct oversight or control,
    but you certainly back the jihad-like sentiment they live by.<br><br>
    
    So, we expect that Hamas and Hezbollah keep Iran's decisions in mind, even amidst raging war.
    Practically, you are head of the anti-Israeli mission.<br><br>

    <h3>Transport</h3>
    <i>We claim no expertise on transport, this is merely an example of 
        "profit-driven market directed by ministries to keep it simple and useful".</i><br>
    This sector ensures:
    <ul>
    <li>1. readiness to evacuate a large amount of people or deliver them supplies quickly (any place in the country)
    <li>2. cheap slow transport for masses of material or goods across large distances (horse-powered chariots are literally enough)</li>
    <li>3. a small operational force of (probably) helicopters for emergency or quick transport of urgent passengers
    <li>4. affordable transport of people to work will be profitable in just very few places across the country. So, routine passenger transport is just taxi for rich businessmen.
    <li>5. observes the places it travels and brings interesting / concerning news first-hand
    </ul>
    The government will promote a company that enhances their normal work (2. and 4.) to fulfill 5.<br>
    Companies for 1. and 3. will get rewards from the ministry directly:<br>
    1. for <ul>
        <li>total weight (worth of people) evacuable per hour, given distance is 100km or more</li>
        <li>maintaining bases with water / electricity in remote locations, so every place is within 100km of the needed supplies</li>
    </ul>
    3. for <ul>
        <li>Proving to be ready and reachable at any time</li>
        <li>Maintaining small secret bases near political residences and quick access to them. This lets them move quickly without people knowing.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div id="agriRules" class="modal" style="font-size: small;">
    In Africa, a large part of solving poverty (and hunger) is preventing stealing and violence.<br>
    So, we will ask local communities to name one person responsible for dividing food supplies among them.
    The person needs to be a force and a safekeeper in their community and speak Arabic or English on their behalf. <br><br>
    This person will receive our AfriAgri starter pack (see below). 
    They will distribute free food, so no profit involved. <br>Instead, their incentive to improve is to support community life:<br>
    If the community gains recognition in the region, be it through organizing events or watching over the safety of the land, the AfriAgri leader can get promoted.<br><br>
    Proven as sensible leaders / mediators, they will become<br>
    heads of prestigious schools, judges or council chairmen. This brings intuitive 
    justice and relationships into politics, which is what we embrace.<br><br>
    <b>Fun fact: Model of agriculture in dry, desolate land</b><br>
    A light, simple-to-build, scalable construction that can produce certain crops (and protect from heat/drought)
    <img src="afriAgri.png" width="300"><br>
    <b>1. Water container.</b> Should be of <b>highly elastic material</b> so it can be
    transported small & shapeless, stretched out and wrapped around the corners to form a large monolithic insulation (and hold water in it).<br>
    <b>2. Osmotic membrane.</b> Allows water to pour into the soil, but holds the soil from dissolving into the water. The membrane should cover the whole floor (no. 4) and be stretchable, so plant roots can expand downward.<br>
    <b>3. Synthetic soil.</b> 
    Each plant gets a thin layer of nutrient-rich soil 
    (chemically carved so the nutrient flow is similar to that in the plant's natural soils). 
    Each crop type needs to be grown large-scale, so that producing and importing synthetic soil pays off.<br>
    <b>4. Floor.</b> Same material as the container, but when set up, we make a grid of holes in it, cover it with the membrane 
    and push that membrane through each hole downward to touch the water. 
    Then fill such pockets with plant seeds covered in soil and start growing. <br>
    <b>5. Roof/wall.</b> Turns sun heat into electricity and stores it. The efficiency of energy production needn't be as high as solar panels, but the covered area needs to be protected from excess heat. 
    To allow in sunlight, the roof is divided into segments (unidimensionally, so each segment can be folded away by grabbing it from the side of the roof).<br><br>
